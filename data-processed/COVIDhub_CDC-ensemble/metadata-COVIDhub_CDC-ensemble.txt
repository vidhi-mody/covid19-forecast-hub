ensemble_of_hub_models: true
methods: An ensemble, or model combination, of submitted forecasts to the
  COVID-19 Forecast Hub.
data_inputs: Forecasts of weekly cases and deaths, cumulative deaths, and
  daily hospitalizations from other models.
methods_long: "This model collects the forecasts that have been communicated by
  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prior to July 28, 2020,
  this model's forecasts were calculated as an equally weighted mean of forecasts
  from all eligible models (COVIDhub-4_week_ensemble). Starting the week of
  July 28, 2020, an equally weighted median of eligible forecasts was used
  (COVIDhub-4_week_ensemble). Starting the week of November 15, 2021, an
  equally weighted median of eligible forecasts was used for forecasts of cases
  and hospitalizations (COVIDhub-4_week_ensemble), and a weighted median was used
  for forecasts of incident and cumulative deaths (COVIDhub-trained_ensemble).
  The weighted median calculates model weights based on their relative
  performance over the 12 weeks prior to the forecast date."
